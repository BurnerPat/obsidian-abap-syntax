# ABAP Syntax for Obsidian

This plugin adds syntax highlighting for the ABAP language to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

It is based on [larshp](https://github.com/larshp/)'s awesome [ABAP syntax plugin for CodeMirror](https://github.com/larshp/codemirror-abap).

# Usage

For the time being, simply run `npm run build` and copy `index.js` and `manifest.json` to a new folder `obsidian-abap-syntax` in your vault's `.vault/plugins` folder.
